    </header>
    <p>I was born in Michigan, lived in Illinois as a small child and then ended up back in Michigan for most of my life.  I
    graduated from Rockford High School.  Then I studied all things computers in college at Grand Rapids Community 
    College and Ferris State University.  I am currently employed at <a href="https://www.harriscomputer.com/">Harris Computer</a> 
    where I work on a property tax application called <a href="https://www.aumentumtech.com/">Aumentum.</a>  I mainly work on 
    calculations that keep track of values on people's homes, but I do other stuff as well.</p>
    
    <p>For my hobbies, I will do tutorials and read books on programming.  I also try to keep my mind in shape by learning Spanish 
    and my body in shape by exercising.  If I get a chance, I have an interest in electronics and will build some circuits, or I
    will try to learn something in Adobe.</p>
