				<p>I was born in Michigan, lived in Illinois as a small child and then ended up back in Michigan for most of my life.	I
			graduated from Rockford High School.	Then I studied all things computers in college at Grand Rapids Community 
			College and Ferris State University.	I am currently employed at <a href="https://www.harriscomputer.com/">Harris Computer</a> 
			where I work on a property tax application called <a href="https://www.aumentumtech.com/">Aumentum.</a>	I mainly work on 
		calculations that keep track of values on people's homes, but I do other stuff as well.</p>
			
				<p>For my hobbies, I am first and foremost a programmer, so I am always learning new things about coding.	I also am always learning Spanish and math. I also enjoy learning about electrical engineering and try to exercise regularly.</p>
